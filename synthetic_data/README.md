# Synthetic data
Code for testing and generating synthetic data that can be used for training.

# TODO
  1. Move every .pkl files to a single .py (keep or not the pkl files ?)
  2. Make a script/function to create synth stacks easily

# Files
  * `*.pkl`: files containing pickled python object 
  * `synthetic_generation.ipynb`: notebook used to create the synthetic data
  * `synthetic_tests.ipynb`: notebook used to test the synthetic data generation
