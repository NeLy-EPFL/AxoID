# ROI detection and tracking
Python code for automatic Regions Of Interest detection and tracking.  
The goal is to detect the ROIs corresponding to axons over 2-photon neuroimaging data, as a binary segmentation, then track which is which over time.

# Repository structure
  * `detection`: code for detecting the ROIs as binary segmentations
  * `tracking`: code for tracking ROIs' identities through time (TODO)
