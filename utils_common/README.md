# Utils Common
Python code of useful modules and functions that can be used by all approaches.

# TODO:
  1. Check credits for the cross-correlation registration code
  2. Break `ROI_detection.py` into smaller different modules

# Files
  * `register_CC.py`: code for registration with the cross-correlation method
  * `ROI_detection.py`: general functions for the ROI detection
  * `script.py`: contains code useful for running and reusing python scripts
